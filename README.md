# Ames-Iowa-Housing-Dataset-Analysis-in-R
This is my capstone project in the R programming language.
I have uploaded the training, validation and testing datasets. I have also uploaded my final project in the following formats: Rmd, HTML, PDF.
Basically, I am simulating the work of a statistical consultant working for a real estate investment firm in Ames, Iowa. I am asked to develop a model that will predict the price of a house given multiple variables.
The overall organization of the project is as follows:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Development of an initial model
3. Initial model selection
4. Evaluating initial model performance
5. Development of final model 
6. Evaluating final model performance
7. Conclusion
